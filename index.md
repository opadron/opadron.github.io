Welcome to my personal page.  I am an applied mathematician with a passion for
software.  This place will be part micro-blog, and part brain dumping ground for
technical topics I think are neat.  It's under construction, at the moment, but
come back soon for curious code snippets, practical tips, and random ramblings.
