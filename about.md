[Traducción al español](/about-es)

I am a software and systems engineer with over ten years of experience applying my
expertise in computational science and applied mathematics to a variety of engineering
application domains.  My specialties include large-scale workflows for cloud, on-premises,
and hybrid infrastructure; and advanced package-management for modern scientific software
stacks.  I have lead the design and development of many novel solutions to computing
challenges in the life sciences, defense applications, and most recently, our capital
markets.

Among my more recent roles, I was part of the Foundational Software group at
[Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/), where I worked to advance the state-of-the-art in
scalable software management.  The group's efforts enabled key capabilities within the
firm's core engineering function, forming the backbone of the trading systems relied on by
thousands of traders across hundreds of trading desks firm wide.  Our contributions helped
lay the groundwork culminating in the recent
[record-breaking performance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hanktucker/2023/01/22/citadels-16-billion-gain-in-2022-makes-ken-griffins-firm-the-top-earning-hedge-fund-ever/?sh=44f32b103105)
of the firm's funds.

Prior to Citadel, I was a Staff Engineer at [Kitware](https://www.kitware.com/), a
software consulting firm best known for their work on the [VTK](https://vtk.org/),
[ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/), and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) open source
projects.  At Kitware, I worked within the Data and Analytics group, where I contributed
full-stack engineering and DevOps expertise to a number of their internal software
products. These products would later go on to form the core of
[Resonant](https://resonant.kitware.com/), a suite of tools enabling the rapid development
of web-based data and analytics applications.  During my seven-year tenure at Kitware, I
worked on a variety of projects, including a web application for multi-modal analysis of
cancer data, cloud workflows for AI training and inference on satellite images, and better
tooling for scientific software builds.

Prior to Kitware, I was part of the Science and Engineering Application Support team at
the [University of Illinois](https://illinois.edu/)
[National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/), where
I performed acceptance testing- and user support for- the
[Blue Waters](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/project-highlights/blue-waters/)
Sustained Petascale Supercomputer.  At the time, Blue Waters was one of the most powerful
supercomputers in the world, capable of more than 13 Petaflops of *sustained* application
performance.  During this time, I worked closely with the application teams to help them
make the most out of their allocations; debugging, porting, optimizing and developing
scientific codes covering a broad array of applications, including quantum chemistry,
bioinformatics, cosmology, and earth science.  I also made contributions to the Blue
Waters education and outreach initiatives, where I served as engineering liaison to
several external partners, mentored students and early-career scientists, and provided
technical training internally and at external events.  Among these include events at the
[National Computational Science Institute](http://www.computationalscience.org/),
annual meetings of the [Cray User Group](https://cug.org)
([2014](https://cug.org/cug-2014/), [2015](https://cug.org/cug-2015/))
the
[Compute Canada](https://www.computeontario.ca)
[HPC Summer School](https://www.computeontario.ca/2023-summer-school),
and the [NCSA SPIN](https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/6204/1349706967) program.

I earned my M.S. and B.S. degrees in Computational Mathematics from
[Kean University](https://www.kean.edu/), where I studied in the
[School of Integrative Science and Technology](https://www.kean.edu/academics/dorothy-and-george-hennings-college-science-mathematics-and-technology/school-integrative).
My research focused on parallel numerical algorithms for the simulation of continuous,
dynamic multi-physics systems characterized by partial differential equations.
