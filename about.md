I am a software and systems engineer with over 10 years of experience applying my
expertise in computational science and applied mathematics to a variety of engineering
application domains.  My specialties include large-scale workflows for cloud, on-premises,
and hybrid infrastructure; and advanced package-management for modern scientific software
stacks.  I have lead the design and development of many novel solutions to computing
challenges in the life sciences, defense applications, and most recently, our capital
markets.

In my most recent role, I was part of the Foundational Software group at
[Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/), where I worked to advance the state-of-the-art in
scalable software management.  The group's efforts enabled key capabilities within the
firm's core engineering function and helped lay the groundwork culminating in the recent
[record-breaking performance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hanktucker/2023/01/22/citadels-16-billion-gain-in-2022-makes-ken-griffins-firm-the-top-earning-hedge-fund-ever/?sh=44f32b103105)
of the firm's funds.

Prior to Citadel, I was a Staff Engineer at [Kitware](https://www.kitware.com/), a
software consulting firm best known for their work on the [VTK](https://vtk.org/),
[ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/), and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) open source
projects.  At Kitware, I worked within the Data and Analytics group, where I contributed
full-stack engineering and DevOps expertise to a number of their internal software
products. These products would later go on to form the core of
[Resonant](https://resonant.kitware.com/), a suite of tools enabling the rapid development
of web-based data and analytics applications.  During my seven-year tenure at Kitware, I
worked on a variety of projects, including a web application for multi-modal analysis of
cancer data, cloud workflows for AI training and inference on satellite images, as well as
better tooling for scientific software builds.

Prior to Kitware, I was part of the Science and Engineering Application Support team at
the [University of Illinois](https://illinois.edu/)
[National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/), where
I performed acceptance testing- and user support for- the
[Blue Waters](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/project-highlights/blue-waters/)
Sustained Petascale Supercomputer.  At the time, Blue Waters was one of the most powerful
supercomputers in the world, capable of more than 13 Petaflops of *sustained* application
performance.  During this time, I worked closely with the application teams to help them
make the most out of their allocations; debugging, porting, optimizing and developing
scientific codes covering a broad array of applications, including quantum chemistry,
bioinformatics, cosmology, and earth science.  I also made contributions to the Blue
Waters education and outreach initiatives, where I served as engineering liaison to
several external partners, mentored students and early-career scientists, and provided
technical training internally and at external events.  Among these include events at the
[National Computational Science Institute](http://www.computationalscience.org/),
annual meetings of the [Cray User Group](https://cug.org)
([2014](https://cug.org/cug-2014/), [2015](https://cug.org/cug-2015/))
the
[Compute Canada](https://www.computeontario.ca)
[HPC Summer School](https://www.computeontario.ca/2023-summer-school),
and the [NCSA SPIN](https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/6204/1349706967) program.

I earned my M.S. and B.S. degrees in Computational Mathematics from
[Kean University](https://www.kean.edu/), where I studied in the
[School of Integrative Science and Technology](https://www.kean.edu/academics/dorothy-and-george-hennings-college-science-mathematics-and-technology/school-integrative).
My research focused on parallel numerical algorithms for the simulation of continuous,
dynamic multi-physics systems characterized by partial differential equations.
